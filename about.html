            Savings and retirement are inherently random processes which makes it hard to plan for them reliably.
            This site allows you to run thousands of simulations of different retirement or savings scenarios to
            understand the
            likelihood of different outcomes. Normally when we think about saving for the future we think in terms of
            one value.
            For example, f I have two million dollars at age 75 I can retire, or if I save $1,000 a month, in 10
            years
            I'll have ...
            This is easy to think about but in reality these numbers are much fuzzier. Since the stock market is random
            the Amount
            of money that you will have any given year is somewhat random which means that these future projections are
            distributions.
            By using Monte Carlo Sampling we can run thousands of simulations and get a representation of what the
            likely outcomes
            are for your finances at any future date. The way to use this site is to estimate distributions of wealth
            over time,
            and understand the simulated probability of failure under these simplifying assumptions.

        <ul class="marker:text-sky-400 list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 dark:text-gray-500 lg:text-xl sm:px-16 xl:px-48">
            <li>
                <b>Constant Withdrawal Rate</b>: This uses the common strategy of withdrawing a constant percentage of
                your portfolio each year. You'll often see folks talk about the 4% withdrawal rule. If you wanted to
                run
                that simulation, set Desired Withdrawal Rate to 0.04. Desired Withdrawal Rate only appears when this
                strategy is selected.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Constant Withdrawal Amount</b>: This strategy is similar to the Constant Withdrawal Rate strategy
                except that it uses a fixed dollar amount instead of a percentage. The fixed amount is set by the
                Minimum Amount Withdrawn per Year input.

                retirement. A full explanation can be found <a

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Dynamic Minimum Withdrawal</b> This strategy looks at the performance of the previous year and
                scales
                the withdrawal for this year based on what previously happened to the portfolio. For example if the
                portfolio lost money the previous year then the dynamic withdrawal strategy would take the minimum
                amount. If the previous year had huge returns it would scale up the amount that is withdrawn.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Constant Saving Amount</b>: This is a special case. This runs the simulation in reverse. which runs
                the simulation in reverse in order to tell you how much money you will have saved over time. Instead of
                withdrawing money, the system uses the input to `minimum amount withdrawn per year` as the amount that
                you are saving each year and the number of years is how long you want to simulate. For example, if you
                set the withdrawal to $1,000 and the number of years to 10, the results would be a range of how much
                money you might expect to have after 10 years.

            This option only appears when the Constant Withdrawal Rate strategy is selected. This is the percentage
            of
            your total assets that you'd like to withdrawal per year. The default value is 0.04 which is the well
            known4% rule.

            The summary statistics highlight the big picture behavior of the portfolio over time. Looking at this
            table
            we can see that the average amount that we spent per year was $57,656. This makes sense, most years we
            should
            spend that constant withdrawal amount, but due to market conditions some years we didn't have enough
            money
            so this is less than the total. The spending standard deviation tells you how much variation there was
            in
            the spending. So this means that about 68% of the time the spending was between 45k and 70k
            approximately.
            This measure isn't as informative for the constant amount setting because the amount is constant it will
            be
            more interesting under other strategies. The average withdrawal rate looks at the spending divided by the
            portfolio value of
            the previous year. This is the percentage of the portfolio that we spent each year. The average ending
            value
            is how much money on average you have at the last year of the simulation. If you want to die with $0,
            because you hate your family and want to leave them with nothing, then this
            should be $0. However, this leads to a high likelihood of failure, since the randomness of the market might
            send you to $0 earlier than you expected, which is exactly what your Scroogey-heart deserves in this thought
            experiment. Moving on, minimum spend is the lowest amount of money you spent in any
            given year. Probability of failure is the percentage of simulations that failed. If we ran 100
            simulations
            and we ran out of money in two of them then this would be .02 like we see here.

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 lg:text-xl sm:px-16 xl:px-48 dark:text-gray-500 ">Now let's
            take a look at the plots. The first is the total assets over time.</p>

            This represents the total amount of money present in the portfolio at any given time. The blue line is
            the
            average value and the grey lines bound it with 90% confidence. This means that in 90% of the
            simulations
            the value lies between the two grey lines. In this particular case 90% of the time when you are 20 years
            into retirement you should have between $0 and $9 million dollars (super helpful range) but on average
            around $5 million.

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 lg:text-xl sm:px-16 xl:px-48 dark:text-gray-500 ">The next plot
            is a histogram of portfolio values at the end of the simulation. This shows you the
            distribution of how much money there is at the end of your time frame (when you estimate you will die). From
            this plot we can see that most of the values are around $5 million with quite a few at $0 and a long tale of
            unlikely booms where you're the preseident of the yacht club.</p>
